# Analysis

•	Top 5 Crops Produced: This section lists the top 5 crops produced in India by tonnage. In this view, Wheat, Maize, Potato, Cotton, and Nuts are listed from top to bottom. Wheat has the highest production at 1,139,262,519 tons while Nuts have the lowest production at 475,211,677 tons.

•	Top 10 States wrt Area: This section lists the top 10 states in India by area in hectares. Rajasthan is listed first with 542,472,842 hectares and Bihar is listed last with 68,187,044 hectares.

•	Season vs Crop Production: This section is a scatter plot showing crop production by season. The X-axis shows the Seasons (Autumn, Summer, Winter) and the Y-axis shows Production (in Tons).

•	Crop Production Trend-Jan 2000 - Jan 2022: This section shows a line graph that plots crop production over a time period. The X axis shows the Year and the Y axis shows Production (in Tons). There are also markers on the line graph that correspond to the data for each year.

•	Area vs Production: This section is a scatter plot that shows the area used for cultivation for each state plotted against the total production from that state. The X-axis shows Area (in Hectares) and the Y-axis shows Production (in tons).

•	Top 10 States Area Map: This section is a choropleth map of India. Each state is colored according to its total area. Rajasthan is colored the darkest shade of orange, indicating it has the most land area, while Bihar is colored the lightest shade of orange, indicating it has the least land area.

Overall, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of crop production in India. It allows users to see which crops are produced in the greatest quantities, which states produce the most crops, how crop production varies by season, and how it has changed over time. It also allows users to see how crop production relates to the land area used for cultivation in each state.
